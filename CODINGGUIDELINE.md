--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###1. Identation 
	
	- using Tab 
	- max length for each line 80 (nr of columns)
	- space between operators
	- no space near () , inside implementation
	- apeal functions , no space between namefunction and ()
	- before , no space 
	- after , single space
	- implementation for statement with space before ()
	- access specifier no identation 
	- implementation for name class no identation
	- new line after each block of function 
	
	
###2. Identation for {}

	- each brackets on new line 
	- identation same as function
	
	
###3. Naming conventions 

	- local variables : lovercase first letter, UPPERCASE for first letter of
	  another word in name
	- const variables : all name UPPERCASE and _C at the end of name
	- function : first letter UPPERCASE ,UPPERCASE for first letter of
	  another word in name
	- function name will be a verb followed by a substantive
	- enum name : first letter UPPERCASE, UPPERCASE for first letter of
	  another word in name and _E at the end of name
	- enum members : all letters UPPERCASE , ex : NAME_MEMBER

	- class accessors & mutators : get_ or set_ and same name as variable
	- apeal member in class : name of class and ::
	- initialization of each variable in declaration , and closer to the scope 
	  of usage
	- initialization of variable members class in default Constructor
	- declaration of pointer or reference simbols, near type of variable with no

	- name of pointers : lovercase first letter, UPPERCASE for first letter of
	  another word in name and _p at the end of name

	  
###4. Commenting

	- before each begin of file name of autor version of implementation 
	- before each statement
	- comments in headers for functions
	- with // or /* */ for block comments
	- identation same as statement
	

###5. Declaration

	- use headers and cpp implementation
	- headers same name as cpp
	- name files same name as Class ,
